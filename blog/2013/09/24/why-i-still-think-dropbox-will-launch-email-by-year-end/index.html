<p>When Dropbox bought Mailbox I figured they were months away from launching an email service.  Turns out that didn&rsquo;t happen, but the gem of the idea must be there.</p>

<p>Dropbox is poised to revolutionize email by killing attachments.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just do a search for dropbox.com if your email client and look at how many times you have pasted a link in there, or someone has sent you one.</p>

<p>I have over 500!</p>

<p>I am also a power Dropbox user.  It was one of the most painless $50 / year I ever spent.  I got it, I love it.  I tell everyone to use it.</p>

<p>We use Google Drive at work but it doesn&rsquo;t quite do it for me.  I was hoping that the big G could deliver a true G-Drive the way I was promised they would.  They didn&rsquo;t.  I love the big D (ya, I know).</p>

<p>So what are they waiting for?  I have no idea to be honest.  It&rsquo;s not a marketing move, it&rsquo;s likely a feature / integration / polish move.</p>

<p>This will be their first big software move outside of their core application since opening up the Dropbox API.  Which, if you think of it, was very smart for them internally since they are no doubt using it to build their email client.</p>

<p>The client will run Mailbox software for sure and maybe do some things that we can&rsquo;t even think of yet&hellip; probably not.  I have some ideas for email, but no one seems able to do them.  Let&rsquo;s hope they surprise us.</p>

<p>The big question is privacy and inertia.  I love Gmail and I hate Google sometimes.  I will likely never part from Gmail.  I know that the NSA&hellip; but truly I am cynical that any email service is truly protected from that.  I choose Google for a lot of reasons.  If Apple and iPhone dropped support for Gmail, I would become an Android user.</p>

<p>However, being an early adopter I would checkout Dropbox Mail.  I would probably even love it, given the amount of time I spend sending and receiving Dropbox links.  Are there enough people like me out there?  Not sure.  I jiust can&rsquo;t help but think of Hotmail&rsquo;s brilliant email signature that is credited for getting them all their users.</p>

<p>Dropbox&rsquo;s could look like</p>

<p>+++
Hate attachments?  We do too.  Start emailing without attachments at getmydbox.com</p>

<p>The Ad campaign writes itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Buddha taught the world to drop attachments.  We listened.  DBox.  The first email without attachments.</p>

<p>Email without attachments. Enlightened. via Dropbox.</p>

<p>Drop attachments. Pickup Dbox.</p></blockquote>

<p>Something like that.  @Drew, you can use that if you want.  All I ask is that you send me a T-Shirt.</p>

<p>Peace and love.</p>

<p>Kent</p>
